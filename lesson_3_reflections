When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when you are working from different computers


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

b/c you may not want all the changes from GitHub locally on Git


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is when you take gitHub repository to edit but you don’t want changes reflected back in the original repository

clone is when you make a copy of a gitHub repository on you local machine for use

branch contains a series of commits.
